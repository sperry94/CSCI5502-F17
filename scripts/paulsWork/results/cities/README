This directory contains files of the output from running the Naive Bayesian Classifier with associated list of review IDs for the city identified by the name.

The classifier is trained with the first 2/3 of the data and tested with the last 1/3.  Many of the cities results files have two sets of results.  This is due to the fact that originally only 10,000 reviews were pulled for each city.  Originally the 10,000 were randomly selected when the list of review IDs were generated.  Later the classifier algorithm randomized the list prior to dividing into training and testing. This allow us to pull all the restaurant reviews for a given city.

It is interesting to not that the classifier accuracy improved in 8 of the 10 cases where we increased the sizes of the training and test data sets. In general the difference is relatively small but in a couple instances the results improved significantly.
